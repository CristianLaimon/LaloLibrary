# Lalo Library

A simple library made for winforms applications and some utilities for C#.

This library does not pretend to be serious, it is a small compendium of all the algorithms that I have made myself reinventing many of them for learning, fun and educational purposes. It is my Swiss army knife for my daily learning. I haven't thought about performance yet since it's for small projects.



If you want to use this library, go ahead, I don't mind, I'm glad you find it useful!



I would like to say that this project is in **really** early and exploratory development. I will be updating this eventually 🦊.



If you want to fork this project, improve it or whatever with it. I would appreciate it if you could give me credit. That would be so ♥️🦊⭐



Note: This library only works on WINDOWS...so far.
