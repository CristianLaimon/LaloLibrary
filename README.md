A simple library made for c# applications for general purpose with quolity of life (QOL) algotythms, reinvented algorythms and a section of utilities for winforms applications.

This contains:
- QOL classes to work with basic engineering (geometry, calculus, physics, etc..)
- Algorythms to work with basic data like strings, arrays, and more comfortable functions
- Reinvented some essential concepts from basic data structures (stacks, queues and more for learning)
- Methods to handle figures drawing on winforms applications better than the default way to do it.
- String parser classes

But more important: this wiil be a small compendium of all the algorithms that I have made myself and other friends of mine to make our life easier in our travel to improve our coding skill.

This library does not pretend to be serious, we're reinventing many of this algorythms for learning, fun and educational purposes. It is our Swiss army knife for our daily learning. I haven't thought about performance yet since it's for small projects.

If you want to use this library, go ahead, I don't mind, I'm glad you find it useful!

I would like to say that this project is in **really** early and exploratory development. I will be updating this eventually 🦊.

If you want to fork this project, improve it or whatever with it. I would appreciate it if you could give me credit. That would be so ♥️🦊⭐

Note: Part of the code of this library only works on WINDOWS, but the rest should work on other platforms I haven't tested that yet.

# How do i use this library?
It is divided in namespaces to differenciate their funcionality, which are the following:


## Namespaces Availables

Lalolibrary

{

    **Lalolibrary.DataStructures**

    **Lalolibrary.Exceptions**

    **Lalolibrary.Forms.Utils**

    **Lalolibrary.Geometry**

    **Lalolibrary.Maths**

    **Lalolibrary.Parsers**

    **Lalolibrary.Physics**

    **Lalolibrary.Utils**

}
